\# Mine Safety Sensor Monitor ⚒️



A C-based console application that simulates underground mine safety sensors, designed for mining and resource companies.



\## Features

\- Simulates \*\*three critical sensors\*\*:

&nbsp; - Temperature (°C)  

&nbsp; - Methane Gas (%)  

&nbsp; - Equipment Load (%)  

\- Provides \*\*real-time alerts\*\* when unsafe thresholds are exceeded.  

\- \*\*Continuous monitoring\*\* (multiple cycles with delay).  

\- Logs sensor readings and alerts to `safety\_log.txt` with \*\*timestamps\*\*.  



\## Example Output

Cycle 1

Mine Safety Sensor Monitor

Temperature reading: 50 C

ALERT: Temperature too high!

Methane reading: 2.75 %

ALERT: Methane level unsafe!

Equipment Load: 90 %

ALERT: Equipment overload risk!
